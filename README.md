# RHU-SIS-PROJECT  
  
COSC333: Web Programming Project  
  
The aim of this project was to create a modern front-end design prototype for the Rafik Hariri University student information system website of the link "http://sis.hcu.edu.lb/", otherwise known as SIS. The most important features of the actual SIS was combined with added features such as a GPA calculator and a study plan viewer. The project proved to be a helpful experience where we applied everything learned from the web programming course into the project. 

The website uses json to read data. A database was not established for the website.
